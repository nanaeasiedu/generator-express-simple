[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-express-simple.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-express-simple)

A simple express generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Overview

The generator comes with [jquery](http://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Newly added functionality is the ability to choose between express 3.x setup and express 4.x.

Get to know more about express 4.x over [here](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/Migrating-from-3.x-to-4.x) and [here](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/Migrating-from-3.x-to-4.x).

Express-generator-simple supports these css preprocessors :

- [less](http://lesscss.org)
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com)
- [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)

<br></br>and these view engines :

- [jade](http://jade-lang.com)
- [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)
- [ejs](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs)

Added support for the Gruntfile in either coffeescript or javascript
Currently working on choosing between gulp and grunt as the build tool

## Installing

install generator-express-simple by running

```shell
npm install -g generator-express-simple
```

## Usage
```shell
yo express-simple [appname]
```
appname - optional

Now your app is ready to be run.

## Running
Removed nodemon from the build task because the new version of nodemon eats up a lot of memory.
Install version 0.7.10 of nodemon:
```shell
npm i -g nodemon@0.7.10
```

and to start the application run
```shell
nodemon -L --watch [folder] --watch [another folder] --debug app.js
```
For more information on using the version 0.7.10 of nodemon check it out over [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/tree/v0.7.10)

If you are using gulp as your build tool, you will have to start the node inspector tool from another terminal by running
```shell
node-inspector --save-live-edit --web-port=[Number] --hidden=[Array]
```

Then in another terminal run
```shell
grunt
```
or

```shell
gulp
```
to watch and build the application depending on the build tool you chose
